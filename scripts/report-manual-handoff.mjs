## Setup requirements

${

## Automated evidence

${verificationSummary(result)}

## Known limitations

- There is no repository-controlled hosted preview URL.
- Full browser automation is not installed; current stable runtime/security workflows use real Next.js HTTP and PGlite tests.
- Production activation remains blocked for approved live email/SMS/private-object-storage/malware-scanning/liveness/video-interview/payment providers; accepted local/test adapters are not live production providers.
- Generated reports are intentionally concise; complete successful logs remain in CI only.

## Classification diagnostics

- Changed files examined: ${classification.files.length}
- Handoff-visible features after overlap consolidation: ${handoffFeatures.length}
- Unmatched non-UI files: ${classification.unmatched.length}
