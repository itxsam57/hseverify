# Bookmark: Later

## Purpose

This register records canonical requirements that are not yet fully implemented/accepted plus provider/maintenance items intentionally left open. “Later” never means optional. Resolved requirements remain in resolved history and must not reappear in the open table without an explicit reopen/regression decision.

The exact build gate is `docs/NEXT_BUILD_UNIT.md`; permanent brick status is `docs/bookmarks/MILESTONE_PATH.md`.

## Status meanings

- **Not started** — canonical work has not begun.
- **Partial** — prerequisite behavior exists but the complete canonical workflow is incomplete.
- **Ready to build** — previous brick is accepted and this requirement belongs to the current permitted brick.
- **In progress** — current permitted work is under implementation/acceptance.
- **Provider blocked** — production activation needs an approved external provider/service.
- **Compatibility override** — tested override retained until a safe parent upgrade replaces it.
- **Resolved** — implementation plus required automated/owner acceptance passed.

## Open Later register

| ID | Brick | Requirement | Status | Why still open | Completion target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| LATER-029 | M1.08 | Company verification case | Ready to build | M1.07 Worker identity is accepted; Company registration/verification is now the next canonical brick. | Complete in M1.08 after this M1.07 closure merges and merged `main` is green. |
| LATER-030 | M1.09 | Sites, departments and Company team scoped permissions | Not started | Company operational workspace is not built and remains behind M1.08. | Complete in M1.09. |
| LATER-031 | M1.10 | Worker invitations and Company codes | Partial prerequisite only | Staff provisioning is not the Worker/Company business invitation/code workflow. | Complete in M1.10. |
| LATER-032 | M1.11 | Qualification, experience, employment, skill and leaving-letter records | Not started | Dashboard/Profile does not implement these durable evidence workflows. | Complete in M1.11. |
| LATER-033 | M1.12 | Real public Worker/Credential verification and Report a Concern | Partial prototype/demo only | Clean-rebuild lookup/projection/rate-limit/concern/QR foundation is not accepted. | Complete in M1.12. |
| LATER-035 | M1.05/M3.10 | Live email provider credentials | Provider blocked | Durable queued/local-test delivery is accepted; production provider activation is later. | Activate in M3.10 without changing queue semantics. |
| LATER-036 | M1.03/M3.10 | Live SMS/phone OTP credentials | Provider blocked | Phone OTP state machine is accepted with sandbox delivery. | Activate approved sender/provider in M3.10. |
| LATER-037 | M2.11–M2.12/M3.10 | Live video/interview provider | Provider blocked | Interview workflow/provider adapter is not built. | Build in M2; activate in M3.10. |
| LATER-038 | M1.07/M3.10 | Live liveness/face/document identity provider | Provider blocked | M1.07 accepted the provider-neutral deterministic/fail-closed identity-check boundary; no approved live production provider is connected. | Activate approved live provider in M3.10 without changing M1.07 assurance semantics. |
| LATER-039 | M1.06/M3.10 | Live malware-scanning service | Provider blocked | Durable local/test scanner foundation is accepted; no approved production scanner is connected. | Activate real provider in M3.10 without bypassing accepted lifecycle. |
| LATER-040 | M3.05/M3.10 | Live payment provider and signed webhooks | Not started / provider blocked | Billing belongs to M3 and requires approved credentials. | Complete M3.05 then activate in M3.10. |
| LATER-043 | M1.01/M3.10 | Hosted preview URL and production traffic switching | Provider blocked | Provider-neutral artifact exists; hosted traffic integration is not connected. | Activate in M3.10. |
| LATER-044 | M1.01/M3.10 | Remove explicit PostCSS and Sharp compatibility overrides | Compatibility override | Next.js `16.2.12` still uses tested secure-floor overrides. | Remove only after a safe Next.js upgrade passes the complete gate. |

## Active progress record

### M1.08 — Company Registration and Verification

- **Status:** READY TO BUILD only after the M1.07 closure branch passes exact-head verification, merges without drift and merged `main` passes the complete gate.
- **Open M1.08 Later ID:** `LATER-029`.
- **M1.09 through M1.12:** BLOCKED in canonical order.
- **Exact gate:** `docs/NEXT_BUILD_UNIT.md`.
- **Accepted prerequisites:** M1.01–M1.07 DONE; M1.07 final owner acceptance is recorded in `docs/testing/results/M1_07_FINAL_ACCEPTANCE.md`.

No M1.08 runtime/product implementation belongs in the M1.07 closure branch. The closure only makes M1.08 the next permitted brick after its own exact-head and merged-main release gates succeed.
