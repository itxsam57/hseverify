## Authority

Permanent build-order and accepted-brick record for the HSE Verify Phase 1 clean rebuild. Frozen product authority: **HSE Verify Master Product, Feature, Workflow, UX and Engineering Specification — Phase 1 Frozen Scope — 1 August 2026**. `docs/NEXT_BUILD_UNIT.md` is the exact current gate.

A brick is formally DONE only after implementation, complete automated release gates, exact-head merge discipline, merged-main verification and owner/browser acceptance where visible behavior requires it.

## Milestone 1 status

## M1.12 active gate

M1.12 is the only active product brick, on branch `build/m1-12-public-verification-foundation` from exact verified M1.11 merged-main boundary `ff296f7d59a6505241796f654249c3df6b97763d`.

M1.12 owns:
- public `/verify` entry with bounded manual identifier lookup;
- Worker ID search using the permanent M1.07 Worker ID authority;
- explicit public-safe projection allow-list and fixed public result-state vocabulary;
- non-enumerating, rate-limited public lookup;
- opaque result capability route rather than raw internal identifiers;
- user-activated QR/camera route foundation with manual fallback;
- safe credential-concern handoff using an opaque result/reference token;
- permanent privacy-leakage, rate-limit, replay/concurrency, migration/restart and lower-brick regression coverage.

M1.12 does **not** own M3.01 credential issuance, M3.02 Living Record administration, M3.03 scoped share links, M3.07 credential suspension/revocation administration, Reviewer evidence decisions, assessment eligibility/delivery, interview decisions or public private-document access.

## Canonical remaining roadmap

The frozen roadmap contains **37 bricks total: 12 in Milestone 1, 13 in Milestone 2 and 12 in Milestone 3.**

M2.09 — Integrity Engine
M2.10 — Written Scoring and Review Engine
M2.11 — Interview Scheduling and Assignment
M2.12 — Interview Console and Playbook
M2.13 — Decision Engine

### Milestone 3 — all BLOCKED

M3.04 — Company Action Centre and Analytics
M3.05 — Billing and Subscriptions
M3.06 — Reports and Delivery
M3.07 — Appeals, Renewal, Suspension and Revocation

M3.09 — Privacy and Accessibility Operations
M3.10 — Production Integrations
M3.11 — Load, Security and Recovery Certification
M3.12 — Production Launch and Operational Handover

## Correct execution order

1. Finish M1.12 exact-head and merged-main engineering release.
2. Run M1.13 combined Milestone 1 owner/browser acceptance covering deferred visible surfaces M1.08–M1.12.
3. Only after combined PASS, record M1.08–M1.12 owner closure and unlock M2.01.
4. Continue M2.01–M2.13, then M3.01–M3.12.

No prototype or later-brick code may bypass this order.
