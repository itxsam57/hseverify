# M1.04 Authorization Foundation — Windows Owner Hard Test

## Acceptance rule

Run this guide only after the feature branch is merged to `main` and CI is green.

This accepts only M1.04 internal subunit 1. It does not accept complete tenant isolation or the whole M1.04 brick.

Stop at the first failure. Record it as `LATER-OWNER-###` before repair.

## Environment

- Windows 10
- Normal Command Prompt
- Node.js 22.23.1 or supported Node >=20.9
- repository: `C:\Users\arsla\hseverify`
- no Administrator terminal
- Windows Developer Mode may remain OFF

## A. Synchronize and establish a clean baseline

```cmd
cd /d C:\Users\arsla\hseverify
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status --short
git rev-parse HEAD
node -v
npm ci --no-audit --no-fund
```

Expected:

- clean tracked state;
- supported Node version;
- install succeeds without `--force`.

## B. Apply the M1.04 migration

Keep the existing local M1.03 `.env.local`. Then run:

```cmd
npm run db:status
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:status
```

Expected final status:

```text
0001_platform_foundation: applied
0002_authentication_foundation: applied
0003_worker_registration_otp: applied
0004_authentication_completion: applied
0005_authorization_tenant_isolation: applied
```

No existing account, session, Worker Profile or authentication record may be removed.

## C. Focused source and domain gate

```cmd
npm run check:authorization
npm run test:authorization
```

Expected:

- explicit permission registry passes;
- no wildcard permission exists;
- Root does not receive routine tenant management;
- opaque tenant and membership IDs pass;
- tenant role ceilings pass;
- grant-above-authority tests pass;
- missing, mismatched and inactive tenant context is denied.

## D. Focused migrated database gate

```cmd
npm run test:authorization-platform
```

Expected:

- tenant tables exist;
- only accounts assigned the Company portal role can hold tenant membership;
- duplicate current membership state is rejected;
- contradictory tenant/membership lifecycle state is rejected;
- unknown/wildcard and duplicate permission overrides are rejected;
- `0005` rollback/reapply regression passes.

## E. Complete application gate

```cmd
npm run check
```

Expected:

- every accepted M1.01–M1.03 test still passes;
- authorization source/domain/database tests pass;
- strict TypeScript, ESLint, runtime smoke and production build pass;
- source configuration remains unchanged.

Do not run `npm audit fix --force` if npm reports only the already-recorded moderate PostCSS advisory below the configured high-severity failure level.

## F. Manual migration rollback and reapply

Stop every development server. Then run:

```cmd
npm run db:status
set HSE_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_DB_ROLLBACK=true
npm run db:rollback
set HSE_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE_DB_ROLLBACK=
npm run db:status
npm run db:migrate
npm run db:status
```

Expected:

1. rollback removes only `0005_authorization_tenant_isolation`;
2. `0001` through `0004` remain applied;
3. no M1.03 account/session/authentication data is lost;
4. migration reapply restores `0005`;
5. the rollback acknowledgement is cleared immediately and is not added to `.env.local`.

## G. Existing authentication regression

Start the server:

```cmd
npm run dev
```

Confirm briefly:

1. Worker login page opens.
2. Existing Worker credentials still sign in.
3. Company login still requires password and TOTP.
4. A Worker session opening `/company/dashboard` is still denied.
5. A signed-out request to `/company/dashboard` still redirects to `/company/login`.

This step proves the new schema did not weaken M1.03. No Company tenant workflow is expected yet.

Stop the server with `Ctrl+C`.

## H. Final clean state

```cmd
git status --short
git diff --check
git diff -- tsconfig.json package.json package-lock.json next.config.ts
git status -sb
```

Expected:

- no tracked changes;
- no whitespace errors;
- no protected configuration changes;
- `.env.local` and `.data` remain ignored;
- no Administrator terminal or Developer Mode requirement occurred.
