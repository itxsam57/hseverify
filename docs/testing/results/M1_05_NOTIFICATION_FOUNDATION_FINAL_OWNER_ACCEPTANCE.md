# M1.05 Subunit 3 — Final Owner Acceptance

## Decision

**DONE — OWNER PASS — 9 August 2026**

M1.05 Subunit 3, Persisted In-App Notifications and Role-Safe Deep Links, is accepted.

This acceptance applies only to Subunit 3. The overall M1.05 Audit and Notification Foundations brick remains **IN PROGRESS** until durable email delivery and the final combined M1.05 isolation/retry/owner acceptance are completed.

## Accepted implementation evidence

- Implementation pull request: `#41`
- Final validated PR head: `5ba526d24ebf4788b1465b2f3d8780052eb51395`
- Merge commit on `main`: `5f0b73e245044474713de54b9c7ae8642b771442`
- Final PR engineering run: `31186076304`
- Final PR validation job: `92890892172`
- Merged-main engineering run: `31186344977`
- Merged-main validation job: `92891735302`
- Final PR complete engineering gate: **PASS**
- Merged-main complete engineering gate: **PASS**
- Owner visible hard test: **PASS — 9 August 2026**
- Owner reported the complete prescribed Subunit 3 handoff passed, including local migration `0009`, focused notification checks, full application gate, real persisted Worker and Company notification flows, unread/read persistence, role-safe deep links, cross-role denial, responsive/keyboard checks, restart persistence, clean shutdown and final Git synchronization checks.

## Accepted capability boundary

The accepted notification foundation provides:

1. one canonical persisted `platform_notifications` store shared across all fixed portals;
2. opaque notification IDs, fixed type vocabulary, bounded schema-versioned metadata and database timestamps;
3. exact recipient-account and fixed-role binding, with trusted tenant/membership binding for Company notifications;
4. notification creation only from committed accepted outbox work through fixed server-side handler `notification.portal.foundation`;
5. recipient-scoped deterministic projection keys and database uniqueness for retry/reclaim duplicate suppression;
6. database validation that source job, recipient, role, tenant/membership, fixed content, metadata and current eligibility agree;
7. immutable notification identity, source, recipient, content and target fields with deletion rejection;
8. one-way durable unread-to-read state with database-generated read timestamps;
9. directly scoped list, count, find and mark-read queries, including direct Company tenant/membership SQL predicates;
10. live session/account/role revalidation and live Company membership revalidation before reads, mutations and deep-link resolution;
11. non-enumerating denial for cross-role, cross-account, cross-tenant, revoked and malformed notification access;
12. one shared persisted notification bell and unread count across Worker, Company, Assessor, Verifier, Admin and Root portals;
13. real role-local notification pages with loading, empty, success and failure states;
14. Worker dashboard notification metrics and recent records backed by the persisted notification service rather than demonstration state;
15. one fixed server-side deep-link registry whose Subunit 3 target is the already-real `portal.dashboard` route resolved from current role authority;
16. browser actions that submit only an opaque notification ID while role, tenant, membership, target and redirect destination remain server-derived;
17. reauthorization at notification open time so a stored notification never becomes an authorization capability;
18. duplicate/concurrency-safe Mark Read with immediate visible state/count update and durable restart persistence;
19. immutable audit facts for notification projection, read transition and denied deep-link access;
20. development/test fixture creation that is production-disabled and exercises the same accepted outbox, worker, projection, persistence and authorization path;
21. deterministic reversible migration `0009_persisted_notifications` with close/reopen persistence proof and preserved historical outbox/audit vocabulary;
22. permanent source, unit, PGlite integration, role/tenant isolation, route/deep-link, concurrency, migration and complete-gate regressions.

## Permanent regression decisions

The following defects found during Subunit 3 validation are permanent regressions:

- older migration-stack tests assuming `0008` would remain permanently latest;
- an outbox migration proof coupled to the globally newest migration rather than explicitly owning `0008`;
- an over-broad route-security regex that treated source order as query-controlled role authority;
- a fixed development-fixture idempotency key that made a second legitimate owner test unreliable;
- notification-center unread totals inferred from a bounded page instead of the authoritative persisted unread count.

These controls must not be weakened by later M1.05 work.

## Explicitly not accepted by this record

This record does not claim completion of:

- durable email queue records;
- email delivery-attempt records;
- provider-neutral email delivery result mapping;
- local/test email delivery adapters;
- live email provider credentials or activation;
- final combined M1.05 adversarial isolation/retry/recovery proof;
- final M1.05 brick-level owner sign-off;
- M1.06 or later milestones.

## Next permitted build unit

**M1.05 Subunit 4 — Durable Email Queue, Delivery Attempts and Local/Test Provider Adapter.**

Subunit 4 may build only on the accepted audit, outbox and notification foundations. It must not weaken their authorization, tenant isolation, audit immutability, idempotency, retry or persistence guarantees, and it must not pull Subunit 5 or M1.06+ scope forward.
