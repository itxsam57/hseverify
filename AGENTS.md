## Universal Project Autopilot V4 — mandatory and observable

This repository is guarded. For every coding, debugging, continuation, CI, UI, deployment, or release task:

1. Load `universal-project-autopilot` before any mutating tool call.
2. Initialize/repair state if needed, then install or refresh the repository guard from the installed skill before requesting a receipt.
3. Start exactly one audit session with `.autopilot/autopilot_audit.py start`, declaring every active skill, material tool, and runtime. Then run `python .autopilot/guard.py session --root .` and show its JSON receipt to the user.
4. Record each newly used skill, specialist, material tool/command, gate result, blocker, and status change with `autopilot_audit.py record`. Close the session only as complete, blocked, owner-required, or exact handover.
5. If receipt or audit validation fails, make no product/code mutation. Reconcile Git, failed CI, broken UI/runtime, inherited dirty work, and audit state first.
6. Known-red CI, startup, browser, security, or purpose behavior is the highest-priority feature until repaired and reverified. Record it with `mark-known-red`.
7. Never use `--no-verify`, disable hooks, forge commit trailers, remove this block, or weaken the compliance workflow.
8. Do not claim completion unless `complete-project` succeeds at the exact clean SHA and the real UI/purpose/security/deployment gates applicable to the project pass.

Routine continuation never requires the owner to type `continue`. A response boundary is not a work boundary.

# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
